          <h3>Why?</h3>
          <img src="images/dead-end-job.jpg" alt="Employee's dead end" height="200px" class="img-inset">
          <p>Bring to the table win-win survival strategies to ensure proactive domination. At the end of the day, going forward, a new normal that has evolved from generation X is on the runway heading towards a streamlined cloud solution. User generated content in real-time will have multiple touchpoints for offshoring.</p>
          <p>Capitalise on low hanging fruit to identify a ballpark value added activity to beta test. Override the digital divide with additional clickthroughs from DevOps. Nanotechnology immersion along the information highway will close the loop on focusing solely on the bottom line.</p>

          <h3>How?</h3>
          <img src="images/coding.jpg" alt="A new path" height="200px" class="img-inset">
          <p>Leverage agile frameworks to provide a robust synopsis for high level overviews. Iterative approaches to corporate strategy foster collaborative thinking to further the overall value proposition. Organically grow the holistic world view of disruptive innovation via workplace diversity and empowerment.</p>
          <p>Podcasting operational change management inside of workflows to establish a framework. Taking seamless key performance indicators offline to maximise the long tail. Keeping your eye on the ball while performing a deep dive on the start-up mentality to derive convergence on cross-platform integration.</p>
          <p>Collaboratively administrate empowered markets via plug-and-play networks. Dynamically procrastinate B2C users after installed base benefits. Dramatically visualize customer directed convergence without revolutionary ROI.</p>

        <h3>Ships long shunned</h3>
          <img src="images/shunned-ship.jpg" alt="The Shunned Ship" height="200px" class="img-inset">
          <p>Until the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial, scarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried on between Europe and the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific coast. It was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the Spanish crown, touching those colonies; and, if space permitted, it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the liberation of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the yoke of Old Spain, and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts.</p>
          
          <p>That great America on the other side of the sphere, Australia, was given to the enlightened world by the whaleman. After its first blunder-born discovery by a Dutchman, all other ships long shunned those shores as pestiferously barbarous; but the whale-ship touched there. The whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony. Moreover, in the infancy of the first Australian settlement, the emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters. The uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth, and do commercial homage to the whale-ship, that cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant, and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations. If that double-bolted land, Japan, is ever to become hospitable, it is the whale-ship alone to whom the credit will be due; for already she is on the threshold.</p>

          <h3>Glowing eulogy in Parliament</h3>
          <img src="images/whale.jpg" alt="Yeah, that's a whale" height="200px" class="img-inset">
          <p>But if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has no aesthetically noble associations connected with it, then am I ready to shiver fifty lances with you there, and unhorse you with a split helmet every time.</p>
          
          <p>The whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler, you will say.</p>
          
          <p>THE WHALE NO FAMOUS AUTHOR, AND WHALING NO FAMOUS CHRONICLER? Who wrote the first account of our Leviathan? Who but mighty Job! And who composed the first narrative of a whaling-voyage? Who, but no less a prince than Alfred the Great, who, with his own royal pen, took down the words from Other, the Norwegian whale-hunter of those times! And who pronounced our glowing eulogy in Parliament? Who, but Edmund Burke!</p>

          <p>Take me to your leader! But I've never been to the moon! Why not indeed! But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop.</p>

          <p>Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be… I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.</p>

          <p>Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Take me to your leader! In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.</p>

          <p>No! The cat shelter's on to me. Kif might! In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.</p>

          <p>Ooh, name it after me! Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.</p>

          <p>A true inspiration for the children. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! Soothe us with sweet lies. I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.</p>
